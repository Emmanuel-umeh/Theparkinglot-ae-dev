# ParkingLot
a dapp where users can track cars parked in a lot via aeternity blockchain

In this challenge i built a parking lot recording dapp that takes into record cars parked in a lot, for example cars parked in an airport that often leads to in most cases no records so when cars are stolen the airport has no record of cars and in cases where it was notified, it may be manipulated which lead to theft. this takes into consideration the possible practical applications of blockchain technology in real life solution based development. even after checking out the records it's still kept on the blockchain for future checks. feedbacks and pull request are welcome.
